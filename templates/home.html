            RSA is a cornerstone of modern cryptography, offering a secure way to protect information by using two
            mathematically related keys: one public for encryption and one private for decryption. Unlike traditional
            methods that rely on a shared secret key, RSA eliminates the need to transmit decryption keys over insecure
            channelsâ€”greatly reducing the risk of interception.
        </p>

            Without public-key systems like RSA, data protection depends on symmetric encryption, which requires that
            both sender and receiver share the same secret key. This shared-key approach creates a critical
            vulnerability: if the key is intercepted during transmission, the entire communication can be compromised.
            RSA overcomes this by allowing anyone to encrypt data with the recipient's public key, while only the
            recipient can decrypt it using their private key.
        </p>

            In addition to securing communications, RSA also enables digital signatures, ensuring both the authenticity
            and integrity of a message. A message signed with a private key can be verified by anyone with access to the
            corresponding public key, proving its origin and confirming it has not been tampered with. This makes RSA
            not only efficient for confidentiality but essential for establishing trust in financial systems, secure
            logins, and digital certificates across the internet.
